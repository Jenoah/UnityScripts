# UnityScripts
In order to be able to use UIManager.cs, you need to also import:
```
	- MoveInputToSelectable.cs
	- UIAnimations.cs
```

You can also include the [Audio/MainVolumeSettings.cs](https://github.com/Jenoah/UnityScripts/blob/master/Audio/MainVolumeSettings.cs) script to automatically fade volume upon pause, but then you need to uncomment those lines in UIManager.cs

## The following files required DoTween
```
AlphaOverTime.cs
FadeText.cs
FadeUI.cs
```
