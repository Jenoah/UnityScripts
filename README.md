# UnityScripts
A few scripts that I use to gain functionality quickly

#### CameraHandler:
  It contains a camera script that allows the camera to pan around an object (eg. the player) at a certain offset

#### PlayerHandler:
  Allows the player to move and rotate whilst respecting physics  

#### Animate:
  Allows the player to animate based on the button presses and places feet on the surface transform. This includes position and rotation
#### VR Rig:
  Adds scripts, models and prefabs to the project which can be used as a basic VR setup. Models are for Oculus Touch (Rift S / Quest) and requires some preperation. These can be found in git file description
